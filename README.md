# Sigil

Sigil is an experimental theorem prover and programming language (work in
progress). 

From a theoretical perspective, Sigil aims to implement Higher Observational
Type Theory (HOTT) for the purpose of computational univalence. Further, it aims
to introduce a form of excluded middle that both is consistent with HOTT and
computes (continuations). 

From a practical/usability perspective, the sigil executable is designed to act
either as a 'regular' compiler or in 'server' mode, where it can perform the
duties of a regular language server (syntax highlighting etc.) as well as
debugging features like expression evaluation, tracing, hot reload and more.
